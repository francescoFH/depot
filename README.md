THE MARKETPLACE
-----
The Marketplace is a web-based shopping cart application that shows many of the features of Rails development such as:
* create maintenance pages
* link database tables
* handle sessions
* create forms
* wrangle modern JavaScript

## Use Cases
* Buyer: uses the Marketplace to browse the products we have to sell, select some to purchase, and supply the information needed to create an order.
* Seller: uses the Marketplace to maintain a list of products to sell, to determine the orders that are awaiting shipment, and to mark orders as shipped.
